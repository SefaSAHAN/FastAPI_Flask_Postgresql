Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my app. This repository contains the code for a web app that allows users to interact with a PostgreSQL database. The app has been implemented using the Flask and FastAPI library and allows you to manage your PostgreSQL database in two different ways.

Getting Started

To set up the app, you will need to have Python and PostgreSQL installed on your machine. You will also need to create a database and set up the appropriate tables. The db.py file in this repository contains the code to create the necessary tables.

Please run the db.py file and enter your own username and password for the PostgreSQL database.

Flask Method

To run the app using the Flask method, navigate to the directory containing the app in your command line and run the following command:

python flask.py

The app will then be available at http://localhost:5000.

FastAPI Method

To run the app using the FastAPI method, navigate to the directory containing the app in your command line and run the following command:

python server.py

After that, you need to run the index.html file in your browser to manage your database correctly.

Conclusion
Thank you for using my app. I hope you find it useful. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.
